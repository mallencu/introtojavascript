# Introduction to CSS!
## For this assignment, you will be tasked with adding CSS code to a pre-existing webpage. You will be working on the file named "webpage.html" for this assignment. 

To begin this assignment, familiarize yourself with the HTML structure provided. Each section (header, main sections, footer) are opportunity for you to set up different elements for styling!  Identify the different sections of the webpage: header, hero section, about, services, portfolio, contact, etc., and how you might make a consistent theme for this simple webpage.

After looking at the HTML structure, please visit this website to learn more about the basic properties you can use with CSS: https://ryanstutorials.net/css-tutorial/css-basic-properties.php 

Now, it's time to style! While we do not have any strict guidelines as to how you are to style your webpage, we will require the following to be included:
1. Look for classes or IDs assigned to specific elements (like .btn, .service, .project) that you can use to target styles more precisely. For every class included in the HTML structure, please create a unique CSS Class Selector in your internal CSS styling code.
2. Please include at least one instance of inline CSS styling, even if it overlaps with your internal CSS stylesheet.
3. In your code, please edit the "background-color" and "font-size" properties. Additionally, include at least four other basic CSS styling properties to your code. (See the link above for other CSS properties you can use!)  

## Once you've completed styling, make sure to "Commit changes" and let your editors know that you've completed the assignment.
