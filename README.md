# Introduction to Javascript!
## For this assignment, you will be tasked with creating a simple Javascript function and displaying its return value. In the file "weather.html", you will be converting an existing value from Celsius to Fahrenheit with a Javascript Function and creating a weather alert declaring whether or not it's hot or cold outside. 

A simple weather website, created by the script in "weather.html", includes the current temperature in a given place in Celsius; in this case, it seems to be 30 degrees Celsius. However, the owner of the website wants to convert this value into Fahrenheit as well as create a weather alert that instantly sends web users a window message saying if it's cold or warm outside depending on the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Task 1: Temperature Conversion Function
1. Create a JavaScript function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit. Please DO NOT simply create a function that simply returns the answer. Operations must be included in your code. (Tip: If you don't already know the formula, Google it! Also, check out the slides from this week to see a function that does the reverse: converts Fahrenheit to Celsius) 
2. Using the unedited <button> tag at the bottom of the script, please create Javascript code that replaces the "30" to the converted Fahrenheit value returned by the function created in the last step. In your final code, there should be a button at the bottom of the webpage that, when clicked, will swap the "30" (degrees celsius) to its equivalent in Fahrenheit. 

Task 2: Weather Alert
1. Implement a script that triggers a window alert based on the converted Fahrenheit temperature (from 30 degrees Celsius).
2. If the temperature is less than 65 degrees Fahrenheit, the alert should display "It's cold outside!" If the temperature is 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, the alert should display "It's warm outside!"
3. Define this alert logic within a <script> tag.
